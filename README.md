# Spectrum-Sensing-with-3-EED
Here are the MATLAB codes for spectrum sensing project done under BITS F423: Thesis. This is a study of different Spectrum Sensing methods such as conventional Energy Detection and 3-EED model using the double threshold value. It uses 3 types of modulation techniques that are QPSK, BPSK and 64-QAM.
